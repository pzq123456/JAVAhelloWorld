# Java experiment code
Here is a code library for my java experiment. In the class of java experiment, we need to write some code to finish the experiment. So I write some code here to help me finish the experiment.

## Code Structure
In the "App.java" file, there is a main function and some other functions which are used to finish the problems. 

## Default README
Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started writing Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
